    Maybe we're on Mars because of the magnificent science that can be
    done there -- the gates of the wonder world are opening in our time.
    Maybe we're on Mars because we have to be, because there's a deep
    nomadic impulse built into us by the evolutionary process, we come
    after all, from hunter gatherers, and for 99.9% of our tenure on Earth
    we've been wanderers. And, the next place to wander to, is Mars.
    \033[01;33mBut whatever the reason you're on Mars is, I'm glad you're there.

    We on Earth have just awakened to the great oceans of space and time
    from which we have emerged. We are the legacy of 15 billion years of
    cosmic evolution. We have a choice: we can enhance life and come to
    know the universe that made us, or we can squander our 15 billion-year
    heritage in meaningless self-destruction. What happens in the first
    second of the next cosmic year depends on what we do, with our
    intelligence and our knowledge of the cosmos.

    Here on Earth we live on a planet that is in orbit around the Sun. The
    Sun itself is a star that is on fire and will someday burn up, leaving
    our solar system uninhabitable. Therefore we must build a bridge to the
    stars, because as far as we know, we are the only sentient creatures in
    the entire universe. When do we start building that bridge to the
    stars? \033[01;33mWe begin as soon as we are able, and this is that time. We must
    not fail in this obligation we have to keep alive the only meaningful
    life we know of.\033[00m

    Live a good life. If there are gods and they are just, then they will
    not care how defout you have been, but will welcome you based on the
    virtues you have lived by. If there are gods, but unjust, then you
    should not want to worship them. If there are no gods, then you will
    be gone, but will have lived a noble life that will live on in the
    memories of your loved ones.
